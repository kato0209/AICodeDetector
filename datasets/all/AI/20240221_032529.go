Sure! Here is a code snippet for the array blocking issue task in Golang:


package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var arr []int
    ch := make(chan bool)

    go func() {
        // Perform some time-consuming operations on the array
        arr = []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
        ch <- true
    }()

    // Simulate some other work being done concurrently
    fmt.Println("Doing other work...")

    // Block until the array operations are completed
    <-ch

    fmt.Println("Array operations completed. Array:", arr)
}
