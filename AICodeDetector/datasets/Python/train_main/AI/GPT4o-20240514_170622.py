    """The Triangular Csiszar-function in log-space.

    A Csiszar-function is a member of,

    none
    F = { f:R_+ to R : f convex }.
    

    The Triangular Csiszar-function is:

    none
    f(u) = (u - 1)**2 / (1 + u)
    

    This Csiszar-function induces a symmetric f-Divergence, i.e.,
    `D_f[p, q] = D_f[q, p
