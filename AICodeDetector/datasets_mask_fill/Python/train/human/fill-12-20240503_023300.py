"""Test command line functions by appendfilename with pytest.

Written for Python 3.9.9 and pytest 6.2.4 and Python 3 as provided by
Linux Debian 12/bookworm, branch testing, this is a programmatic check
of the filename by appendfilename.  Deposit this script in the root of
the folder fetched and unzipped from PyPi or GitHub.  If your system
includes both legacy Python 2 and Python 3, pytest for Python 3 likely
is named pytest-3; otherwise only pytest.  Thus, adjust the script line on
the CLI accordingly when running either one of

pytest -v or python test_appendfilename.py

These instruction will allow verbose testing (flag -v) reported back to the
CLI.re will take over the verbose report
