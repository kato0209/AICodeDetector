# Note: This code is only used if all of pred, cond_true, and cond_false # are scalars. This means its uses are arguably more like tf.cond than # tf.where even though we use tf.where to implement it. pred_ = tf.get_static_value(tf.convert_to_tensor(value=pred)) if pred_ is None: # tf.where(pred, cond_true, cond_false) return cond_true if pred_ else cond_false
