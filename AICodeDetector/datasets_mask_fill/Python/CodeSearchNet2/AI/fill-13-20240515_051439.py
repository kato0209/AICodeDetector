= D_f[q, p]`. Warning: this function makes non-log-space calculations and may therefore be numerically unstable for `|logu| >> 0`. Args: logu: `float`-like `Tensor` with shape `log(u)` from above. name: `optional `str` name prefixed to every op created by this function. Default value: `None` (i.e., 'logu'). Returns: triangular: `Tensor` of shape `[..., M, M]`. Raises: ValueError: if `logu` is not in
