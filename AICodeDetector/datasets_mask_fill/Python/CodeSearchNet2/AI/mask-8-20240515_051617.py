<extra_id_0> seq_lengths: a list of integers, where each element is the length of each sequence, and each element is the length of the <extra_id_1> sequence. The i-th element is the length of the sequence. input_initial_h: initial <extra_id_2> for the cell name: name of the module Returns: A tuple (outputs, output_h), where: outputs: A list of the same length as decoder_inputs of <extra_id_3>
