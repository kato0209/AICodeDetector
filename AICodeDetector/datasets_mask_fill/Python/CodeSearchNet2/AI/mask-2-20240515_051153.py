_flip (bool): If ``True``, the <extra_id_0> crop is <extra_id_1> vertically. If ``False``, the central crop is <extra_id_2> horizontally. Returns: tuple: A tuple of <extra_id_3> and the central crop plus the flipped <extra_id_4> of these (horizontal flipping is used by default). .. note:: This transform returns a tuple of images and there may be a mismatch in the number of inputs and targets your ``Dataset`` returns. .. note:: This function is a wrapper
