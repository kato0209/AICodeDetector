# We use the log4j <extra_id_0> as a default logger for SparkSubmitTask, but the log4j logger # does not have a handler. So we use a <extra_id_1> to avoid logging the same # messages for every task logger = logging.getLogger("spark-submit") handler = NullHandler() handler.setLevel(logging.INFO) logger.addHandler(handler) # Read the logs from the subprocess and extract the Spark driver <extra_id_2> to extract # the <extra_id_3> from
