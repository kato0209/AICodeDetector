` as it is not a `Tensor` or Python `list`. previous_kernel_results: `Tensor` or Python `list` of `Tensor`s representing the previous state(s) of the independent chain(s), _after_ the last batch of `bijector.forward`. The first `r` is used to index independent chains, `r = tf.rank(target_log_prob_fn(*previous_state))`. The `inner_kernel.one_step` does not actually use `previous_state` as it is not a `Tensor` or Python `list
