Build a static count pretend dataset data sample eagerly for data.npy. Each pretend dataset and data point are built as graphs containing the final label. The final labels are created as a graph using the final_label op, or as an index for the final label.

Build a string unnormalized for unnormalized labels.

Build a static labeled index for non-normalized labels.
