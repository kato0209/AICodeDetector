'''
Logistic regression does not make many of the key assumptions of linear
regression and classification models that are based on ordinary least squares
algorithms â€“ particularly regarding linearity, normality, homoscedasticity,
and measurement level.
 
First, logistic regression does not have a linear distribution of the
dependent and independent variables.  
Second, the error terms of the dependent variables do not need to be
non-negative, or normally distributed.
Third, homoscedasticity is not  required.  Finally, the dependent variable 
in logistic regression is not measured on an interval or ratio scale.

Binary logistic regression requires the observations to be binary
and ordinal logistic regression requires the inverse variable to be ordinal.
