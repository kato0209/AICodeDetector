"""Test pad for functions by appendfilename with pytest.

Written <extra_id_3> 3.9.9 and pytest 6.2.4 for Python 3 as provided by
Linux Debian 12/bookworm, branch testing, this is a programmatic check
of functions offered by appendfilename.  Deposit <extra_id_4> in the root of
the folder fetched and unzipped from PyPi or GitHub.  If your system
includes both legacy Python 2 and Python 3, <extra_id_5> Python 3 likely
is named pytest-3; otherwise only pytest.  Thus, <extra_id_6> input on
the CLI accordingly when <extra_id_7> one of

pytest -v test_appendfilename.py
pytest-3 -v test_appendfilename.py

These instruction initiate a verbose testing (flag -v) reported <extra_id_8> the
CLI.re will be a verbose report
